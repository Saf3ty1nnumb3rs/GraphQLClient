# GraphQL Client Side Project
## Project created with a simple server tied into MongoDB with the intent of learning ckient side coding with GraphQL (w/ React)

## Technologies
* Webpack 4
* React 16.8
* React-Router
* Hooks
* Express
* Babel 7
* GraphQL
* Apollo Client
* MongoDB (via mLab)
* Axios
* graphql-tag

## Challenges
This application was based on a server foundation from an older course by Stephen Gride. THe entire dependency base was antiquated and required an update in order to be relevant to the most up to date practices. This was a great opportunity to refactor pre-existing code to modern standards. This entailed an update of React from 15 to 16, Webpack from v2 to v4, Babel from v6 to v7, as well as all of the GraphQL and Apollo packages.
This also presented a great opportunity to utilize some of the latest features of React including Hooks!
